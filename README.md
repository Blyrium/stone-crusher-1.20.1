# Stone Crusher

The Stone Crusher is a new block used to turn Cobblestone (or any stone you may find in the Overworld) into Gravel. Use fuel to power it, and let it work! The Stone Crusher can also crush Gravel into Sand. No need to build a Sand duper anymore!

The Stone Crusher is fast and energy efficient. Feeding it a single plank allows it to crush 6 blocks. Pretty cool, right?

### A few notes

* REI support isn't a priority right now, but I'll get to it eventually.

<summary>Spoiler</summary>

I need to find a tutorial that actually covers 1.20.1 and **not** 1.20.2 first.

* This mod **will not work on 1.20.2 and above**. 1.20 and 1.20.1 and the only two supported versions. I will not update or backport this mod to a different version of Minecraft, but you're free to do so yourself if you wish.
